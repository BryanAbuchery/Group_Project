# Group_Project
The aim of this project was for us to learn about the diferent software tools used in molecular reasearch.
The group was to read a paper, reproduce it, learn how to use BLAST , perform Multiple sequence Alignment, visualize the data and construct da phylogenetic tree using the different tools available before making scientific conclusions.

## Referrence material

To learn concepts used in bioinformatics, it is imperative to learn how BLAST, Genetic Data Alignment and Phylogenetic tree construction work for genomic data analysis and visualization.

In this project, we attempted to reproduce the data found in [this paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/jmv.25700) using genetic analysis tools.

To reproduce our results, ensure that you have the following tools installed;


## Tools and Installations
This tutorial assumes that you have installed the following tools but if not, click on them and you will be redirected to the installation and documentation pages

* [BLAST](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279671/)

* [MUSCLE](http://www.drive5.com/muscle/manual/)

* [MEGAX](https://www.megasoftware.net/dload_mac_beta)

#### Other tools tried are:
1. Mafft multiple sequence Alignment program
2. Kaign tool for Multiple sequence Alignment
3. Aliview - For visualization and generation of phylogenetic tree.

4. Jaliview -For visualization and generation of phylogenetic tree.


## How to Run the script

After Installing the tools above:

- Open your terminal on linux `Ctrl +Alt+T` or `Cmd `+ `space` for MACos

- git clone this repo
`git clone https://github.com/BryanAbuchery/Group_Work`

- cd into Goup_project


- run the Script
` bash Group_Project.sh`
##### This may take some time, please be patient.

- Launch MEGAX and add the file saved on your Group_Project directory; <muscle_query_aligned.afa.fasta> onto the Phylogenetic tree construction platform. 
- Use the Construct/Test Maximum Likelihood tree on MEGAX to obtain a Phylogentic tree.
