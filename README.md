# Group_Project
The aim of this project was for us to learn about the diferent software tools used in molecular reasearch.
The group was to read a paper, reproduce it, learn how to use BLAST , perform Multiple sequence Alignment, visualize the data and construct da phylogenetic tree using the different tools available before making scientific conclusions.

## Referrence material
In this project, we attempted to reproduce the data found in [this paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/jmv.25700) using genetic analysis tools.




## Tools and Installations
This tutorial assumes that you have installed the following tools but if not, click on them and you will be redirected to the installation and documentation sites.

* [BLAST](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279671/)

* [MUSCLE](http://www.drive5.com/muscle/manual/)

* [MEGAX](https://www.megasoftware.net/dload_mac_beta)

#### Other tools tried are:
1. Mafft - For performing Multiple Sequence Alignment.
2. Kalign CLI tool - For Multiple sequence Alignment.
3. Aliview - For performing Multiple Sequence Alignment, visualization and generation of phylogenetic tree.

4. Jaliview -For visualization and generation of phylogenetic tree.


## How to Run the script

After Installing the tools above:

- Open your terminal on linux `Ctrl +Alt+T` or `Cmd `+ `space` for MACos

- git clone this repo
`git clone https://github.com/BryanAbuchery/Group_Work`

- cd into Goup_project


- run the Script
` bash Group_Project.sh`
##### This may take some time, please be patient.

- Launch MEGAX and add the file saved on your Group_Project directory; <muscle_query_aligned.afa.fasta> onto the Phylogenetic tree construction platform. 
- Use the Construct/Test Maximum Likelihood tree on MEGAX to obtain a Phylogentic tree.
