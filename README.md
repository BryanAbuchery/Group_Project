# Group_Project

Learning BLAST, Genetic Data Alignement and Phylogenetic tree construction concepts.

## What the project entails:

To learn concepts used in bioinformatics, it is imperative to learn how BLAST, Genetic Data Alignment and Phylogenetic tree construction work for genomic data analysis and visualization.

In this project, we attempted to reproduce the data found in [this paper] (chrome-extension://gphandlahdpffmccakmbngmbjnjiiahp/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/jmv.25700) using genetic analysis tools.

To reproduce our results, ensure that you have the following tools installed;

* BLAST

* MUSCLE

* MEGAX

## Steps to Follow

Install the tools above

git clone this repo and cd into Group_Project

bash Group_Project.sh

Launch MEGAX and add the file saved on your Group_Project directory; <muscle_query_aligned.afa.fasta> onto the Phylogenetic tree construction platform. Use the Construct/Test Maximum Likelihood tree on MEGAX to obtain a Phylogentic tree.
